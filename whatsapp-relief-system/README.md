### Bot Issues

**Bot won't connect**
- Delete `.wwebjs_auth` folder and restart
- Make sure you're using a valid WhatsApp account
- Check your internet connection

**Messages not being detected**
- Check terminal logs - bot shows which groups it monitors
- Set `MONITORED_GROUPS=` (empty) to monitor ALL groups
- Verify messages contain keywords, phone numbers, or locations
- Check `reports/` folder for local backups

**Contact info errors**
- Bot automatically handles contact errors with fallbacks
- Reports will still be processed with available information

### Dashboard Issues

**Nothing shows on dashboard**
- Make sure server is running (`npm run server`)
- Check browser console (F12) for JavaScript errors

## 🆘 Production Deployment

For real disaster response operations:

1. **Use a Server/VPS**: Run bot and dashboard on a reliable server (not your laptop)
2. **Keep Running 24/7**: Use process managers like PM2 or systemd
3. **Monitor Logs**: Set up log aggregation and alerting
4. **Backup Data**: Regularly backup `api-reports/` folder
5. **Secure API**: Add proper authentication if exposing publicly
6. **Scale**: Consider database (MongoDB/PostgreSQL) for large volumes
7. **Multiple Bots**: Run multiple instances for redundancy

## 🔐 Security Notes

- Keep `.env` file secure (never commit to git)
- Bot session stored in `.wwebjs_auth/` - keep it secure
- API has no authentication by default - add if needed
- Dashboard is public - add login if exposing to internet

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Database integration (MongoDB/PostgreSQL)
- [ ] User authentication for dashboard
- [ ] WhatsApp notifications for high urgency
- [ ] Map visualization of requests
- [ ] Export reports to Excel/CSV
- [ ] Machine learning for better classification
- [ ] Multi-bot coordination
- [ ] Mobile app for field responders
